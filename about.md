Hi, I'm Ari! I'm a research scientist at the Astera Institute studying Mars Terraforming. I also do research with the Los Alamos National Laboratory on the MSL and Mars2020 rover missions. I studied Math & Computer Science at Yale University and graduated with a B.Sc. in 2024. I love to climb trees, memorize numbers, do mental math, play percussion instruments, throw a frisbee, balance on a slackline, spend a long summer day in the park... and write! With this blog, I hope to share ideas, projects, and lists that others might find useful.

To read some of the research I've contributed to, feel free to check out my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n7p0H_wAAAAJ&hl=en). If you are curious about a particular paper you find there but it's pay-walled, feel free to email me and I'll try to share the PDF.
