It wasn't until our second semester that my friend Theo Sandstrom and I figured out how to climb up into the old, elephant-like beech tree, a fixture of Yale's Silliman College courtyard. The tree is older than the castle-like building that surrounds itâ€”older than the university itself. Once we knew how to get into the first branch, our early-morning ritual was to explore the tree more, climb a little further, a little higher.

I've taken hundreds of photos of the tree and from the tree, maybe more than a thousand photos. But my favorites are the photos I took laying on my back on one of the largest branches of the tree. When I look at these photos, I can feel the smooth beech bark against my back and my shoulder blades, the tree holding me up, providing a calm place to rest, away from the always-busy student life on the ground. I feel light, held up by the strong tree. Looking at these photos makes me wish I were back in the tree, watching the leaves dance, the ants crawl, the fuzzy jumping spiders wander, the curious squirrels pause and resume their games of chase, the clouds pass without hurry.

I've recently [uploaded these photos to Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjCw5Jc) to make it easier to scroll and enjoy. They are also [available on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rsTP9aZHV7h-lQRU3biNWLQgaB8u4F_m?usp=sharing).
