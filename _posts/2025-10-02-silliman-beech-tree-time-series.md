It wasn't until our second semester that my friend Theo Sandstrom and I figured out how to climb up into the old, elephant-like beech tree, a fixture of Yale's Silliman College courtyard. The tree is older than the castle-like building that surrounds itâ€”older than the university itself. Once we knew how to get onto that first branch, our early-morning ritual became exploring the tree.

I've taken hundreds of photos of the Silliman Beech. My favorites are the photos I took while laying on the third-lowest branch, looking up. When I look at these photos, I can feel the smooth bark against my back and my shoulder blades, the branch holding me up, providing a calm place to rest, away from the busy student life of the ground below. Looking at these photos makes me wish I were back in the tree, watching the leaves dance, the ants crawl, the fuzzy jumping spiders wander, the curious squirrels pause and resume their games of chase, the clouds pass without hurry.

I've recently [uploaded these photos to Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjCw5Jc) to make them easier to scroll through and enjoy. They are also [available on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rsTP9aZHV7h-lQRU3biNWLQgaB8u4F_m?usp=sharing).
