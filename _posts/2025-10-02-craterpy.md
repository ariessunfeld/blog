During the first half of 2025 I had the great opportunity to work with [Christian Udovicic](https://cjtu.github.io/) and [Emily Costello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jZF1IKkAAAAJ&hl=en), researchers at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, on a Python library that simplifies data science with crater datasets. Christian taught me a lot about open-source development, and I'm happy to say that now forking a repo, opening a PR, and going through code review feel much more familiar. I also have a newfound appreciation for open-souce practices and the [Open Planetary](https://www.openplanetary.org/) community, in particular. 

I helped test, develop, and document Christian's long-running project, Craterpy, and contributed to maturing the library to the point where we felt ready to submit it to the Journal of Open Source Software. 

And just three days ago, our paper was published! If you're interested, you can [read it here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.08663.pdf), and [check out the code](https://github.com/cjtu/craterpy) on GitHub.
