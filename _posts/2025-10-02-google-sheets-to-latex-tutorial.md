In late 2024 I was working on a paper in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). I was trying to format a table in the paper nicely in LaTeX, but I kept needing to make changes to the table—add a column, change a value, reorder rows—and it got pretty annoying because of the high syntax overhead. After doing some searching, I learned that you can export tables from Google Sheets directly to copy-paste LaTeX, provided that you first install a specific extension in Google Sheets. (This extension can even handle merged columns and formatting, to an extent!) I found it a little tricky to install and use the extension, so [I made a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/ykTTUH8FWpk) in the hopes that it might help someone down the road. In the video, you'll find all the information you need re: installing the extension, setting it up, and using it to export spreadsheets to LaTeX tables.
