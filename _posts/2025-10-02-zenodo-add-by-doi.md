While working on the literature review for a paper in 2024, I learned about a handy feature in Zotero: If you have the DOI for the article / resource you want to cite, you can use the "Magic Wand" tool to add the article to your bibliography or collection very easily. One thing I really enjoyed about this feature is that it seemed to integrate well with institutional access, so that even if my browser was giving me a paywall, sometimes I could still get the PDF directly into Zotero. I assume this had to do with being logged into Zotero with an email account that was affiliated with an institution with access to the publications... either way, I use this tool a lot, so much so that it's my prefered way to get PDFs for journal articles. 

In particular, I've found this feature to be really helpful when the "Zotero Connector" browser extension fails to fetch the PDF or misses the metadata.

[I made a short tutorial video](https://youtu.be/4IIO1m87y6k?si=d8h1cxGxfx2dvplE) about this feature, so if you think it might be useful to you, feel free to check it out!
