Personal finance checklist:

## credit card & credit score
- Apply for a student/first credit card (CC)
- Set up the account and turn on at least email alerts
- Link the account to your bank account (takes a couple days)
- Turn on automatic **statement balance** full payments from your bank account
- Ensure that the bank account that you’re paying the CC bills from is a **checking** account, and not a savings account. You’re only allowed ~6 withdrawals from most savings accounts each month and it’s surprisingly easy to exceed this limit if you’re paying off multiple credit cards
- Make a Credit Karma account and set up a strong password, connect it with your personal email
- Use Credit Karma to check on your credit score periodically
- Remember to aim for **< 30%** of your credit limit each month; use debit or other means for large payments until you have a larger credit line (this will likely mean **$500 in credit card** each month at first bc credit limit is small at first)
- Every 6 months, use the customer support chat line to request a **credit limit increase**. Report any updated income or assets. Even if there isn’t substantial change in those numbers you will probably see at least some increase.
- Be careful not to spend more on your credit card(s) than you can pay off with your current checking account balance

## savings account
- Pick a bank with a **high-yield savings account (HYSA)**. Aim for **> 3.5% APY**. I have E*Trade Premium Savings, **4% APY**.
- Pick something with no annual fee and no outrageous minimum. Reasonable minima are **$500–$1000**. You should be able to get **4%** with no fees in **2025**.

## checking account
- Ideally you would have your checking account with the same institution as your savings account, as this makes it easier to transfer money to and from as needed. But this is not necessary.
- Don’t worry about maximizing interest (APY) on the checking account. Just be careful to **avoid** any unnecessary fees associated with minimum balances. Some accounts have a requirement that you keep e.g. **> $2k** in your checking account. This is annoying and usually you can find an account with no such minimum. If you do have a minimum like that, just get into the mindset of subtracting the minimum from your balance and thinking about it as if you only actually have that much

## retirement savings
- No matter what your current employment situation is, sign up for a **Roth IRA** and try to max it out. Any contribution is good; even if you can’t max it out in a year, you should still contribute.
- I have a Roth IRA with E*Trade. Because I don’t want to have to think about which stocks to invest in, I chose robo-investing. As a consequence I have to pay **0.35%** of my balance to them each year (averaged out and paid monthly), but this is almost certainly **washed out** by the gains that you will see from the market (e.g. **7% each year**)
- The max you contribute to a Roth IRA as a young person is roughly **$7k/year**. It’s not legal to contribute more than that; you can’t just open a second one and contribute **$14k/year** total.
- If you max it out, it comes to about **$135/week**.
- One way to make it easy and automatic is set up transfers from your checking account to your Roth IRA to automatically run every week or every month for whatever amount you can afford
- If you have a job that offers a **401k** plan, use it. Sign up for it and contribute at least as much as will cause the employer to match up to the maximum amount. For example maybe the employer matches up to **3%** of your paycheck. If your paycheck before tax is **$1000**, this means the employer will match **$30**. So you should contribute at least **$30** to take full advantage of that match. Then your new paycheck will be **$970** before tax, but you’ll get **$30 + $30 = $60** in your 401k every paycheck. 

## cash flow
- I find it helpful to track all of my transactions (simple things like buying a drink at the store, to big things like buying plane tickets) in a spreadsheet. This is a more complex topic which I’ll write about elsewhere. If you do this, you don’t need to rely on automatic categorization
