<!-- # Getting Started with Responsible Personal Finance -->

I was talking to a friend today who graduated from college a few months ago and is moving to New York City in a week. They mentioned needing to open a new bank account in the city, and that they had been putting off opening a credit card. Having gone through a similar transition myself just a few years back in 2020, when all of a sudden I was working and had an income and was thinking about things like opening a credit card, connecting it to my bank accounts, wondering what sort of bank accounts I should have, wondering if I should be investing and/or saving for retirement, etc., I could relate, and I offered a little advice. After our conversation, I decided to write up some notes on these topics, in the hopes that it might prove useful to other folks in (or recently out of) college who might be thinking about personal finance for the first time.

Many have written on these topic, and none of what you will find below is particularly novel. My aim with this post is simply to share what has worked for me, what I have done, and some details to consider or things watch out for. There is certainly room for improvement and optimization. But, I hope that some will find this collection of notes useful, especially if venturing into personal finance for the first time.

## Credit Card & Credit Score

There are two main reasons to open a credit card. One is to be able to purchase something worth $X even if you don't have $X immediately available in cash. The other is build your credit score, which will help with applications and loans you will likely want to make and take out in the future.  

To use a credit card responsibly and not lose any money to interest payments, you should always pay the credit card statement balance in full each month. To reconcile this with the first motivation for opening a credit card listed above, consider the following example: You have $500 in the bank and you want to buy something worth $1000. You cannot buy it with a debit card, because you only have $500 in the bank. You *could* buy it with a credit card, if your credit limit is more than $1000. Suppose you have a paycheck for $1000 coming next week. Then you can responsibly purchase the item for $1000 dollars using your credit card, since you will have $1500 in the bank by the time you must pay your credit card statement balance (assuming you have no other upcoming deductions from your bank account).

Notes below:

- Apply for a student credit card or first-time credit card
  - Google "Student Credit Card" or "First Time Credit Card" and read an article (probably by Forbes) on the best introductory credit cards. Pick one with no annual fee and a competitive cash-back percentage or other appealing perk.
- Set up an online account and turn on at least email alerts
  - Recommended: Also set up the app and add a homescreen widget with the card balance
- Link the account to your bank account (takes a couple days)
- Turn on automatic statement balance full payments from your bank account
  - This will help avoid any interest payments, assuming you always keep enough in your linked account to pay off the statement balance each month
- Ensure that the bank account that you’re paying the CC bills from is a checking account, and not a savings account. You’re only allowed ~6 withdrawals from most savings accounts each month, and it’s surprisingly easy to exceed this limit if you’re paying off multiple credit cards and making other withdrawals or transfers.
- Make a Credit Karma account and set up a strong password. Connect it with an email account you check.
- Use Credit Karma to keep an eye on your credit score. (Don't obsess over it; checking once every few months is probably fine).
- Keep spending below 30% of your credit limit each month; use debit or other means for large payments until you have a larger credit line. This helps build credit.
  - Example: You open your first credit card and the limit is $1200. Keep spending below ~$400 on this card each month.
- Every 6 months, use the customer support chat line in the credit card's app or website to request a credit limit increase.
  - Report any updated income or assets. Even if there isn’t substantial change in those numbers, you will probably see at least a small increase. This helps increase the amount you can spend while staying below 30%.
- Be careful not to spend more on your credit card(s) than you can pay off that month. 
  - Only spend more than you currently have in cash if you are confident that you will receive a paycheck or other means of income prior to needing to pay the credit card bill.

## Savings Account

My first bank account was with the local credit union in southern Vermont. It was nice to be able to walk into the building, recognize the person behind the desk, and withdraw cash in person. But if you have more than a few thousand dollars in savings, the opportunity cost of not keeping your money in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) makes it hard to justify only having a credit union account, which typically has an interest rate measured in tenths of a percent.

As of Fall 2025, you can open a HYSA with a low (< $1000) minimum deposit, no extraneous fees, and expect $400 annual percentage yield (APY), typically compounded monthly. To put this in perspective: If you have worked a couple summers during college and have $10,000 in savings, simply by putting that money in a HYSA, you could receive $400 in interest each year, or ~$33/month. Another way to think about $10,000 in a HYSA is that it can pay for one or two typical subscriptions.

When opening a new bank account:

- Pick a bank that offers a high-yield savings account (HYSA). Aim for > 3.5% APY. I use E\*Trade, and their Premium Savings account gives 4% APY.
- Open an account with no annual fee and no outrageous minimum. 
  - As of writing, Chase bank requires a minimum deposit of $100,000 for their high-yield savings account (and then they still only give 3.4%). This is outrageous for someone in college or recently graduated.
  - Reasonable minima are $500–$1000. You should be able to find an account with 4% with no extraneous fees.

## Checking Account
- Ideally, you would open a checking account under the same institution as your savings account, as this makes it easier to transfer money to and from those accounts as needed. But this is not necessary.
- Don’t worry about maximizing interest (APY) on the checking account. Just be careful to avoid any unnecessary fees associated with minimum balances. 
  - Some banks have a requirement that you keep e.g. > $2k in your checking account. This is a little annoying, and usually you can find an account with no such minimum. If you do have a minimum requirement like that, just get into the mindset of subtracting the minimum from your balance and thinking about it as if you only have the lower amount. 
  - Example: Minimum required amount = $1000, current balance = $2500. When thinking about "how much money do I have available in my checking account", the answer should be $2500 - $1000 = $1500. 

## Saving for Retirement

When I was 19, about to turn 20, my friend Kai called me and told me to open a Roth IRA. I didn't know what he was talking about, but I knew he was well-informed when it came to finance, and he talked me through what I should do and why. When I'm ready to retire, that advice he gave me might be worth a million bucks.

- No matter what your current employment situation is, open a Roth IRA and try to add as much money to it as possible, up to the maximum amount (after covering your other expenses, of course). Any contribution amount is good. Even if you can’t max it out, you should still contribute. It's not an all-or-nothing situation.
- Opening a Roth IRA as soon as possible extremely advantageous, as the money you contribute in your early 20s will earn more interest, dollar for dollar, over any of the money you contribute thereafter. 
  - For example: Assuming $7000/year contributions and a market return of 7% per year, let X be the age of the person investing when they open the Roth IRA and Y be the amount of money in the Roth IRA at age 65. Then:
    - X = 20 years old $\implies$ Y = $2,000,000 at age 65
    - X = 25 years old $\implies$ Y = $1,400,000 at age 65
    - X = 30 years old $\implies$ Y = $1,000,000 at age 6
  - Notice the difference: From age 20 to age 30, you might contribute only $7000/year, or a total of $70,000 over those ten years. But those $70,000 have the longest to grow, contributing an addition $1,000,000 to the final value of the account compared to someone who starts at age 30. 

- My Roth IRA is under E\*Trade, since that's where I also have a HYSA and checking account. Because I don’t want to have to think about which stocks to invest the money in in, I chose the robo-investing option. As a consequence, I need to pay 0.35% of my account balance to E\*Trade each year. This is almost always washed out by the gains that you I get from the investments themselves (e.g., 7% each year)
- The maximum amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA as a young person is roughly $7k/year. 
  - It’s not legal to contribute more than that; for example, you can’t just open a second one and contribute $14k/year.
- If you max your account out, it comes to about $135/week, to put it in perspective.
- Be sure to cover your more pressing expenses, such as rent, groceries, and bills, before allocating money toward your Roth IRA.
- One way to make it easy and automatic to contribute is to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your Roth IRA. These can be configured to execute without your input every week or every month for whatever amount you can afford.

### 401k

If you are employed at a job that offers a 401k plan, take advantage of it it. Sign up for it and contribute at least as much as will cause the employer to match up to the maximum amount outlined in your contract. 

- For example: maybe the employer matches up to 3% of your paycheck. If your paycheck before tax is, e.g., $1000, this means your employer will match $30. So, you should contribute at least $30 from your paycheck to take full advantage of that match. Your new paycheck will be $1000 - $30 = $970 before tax, but you’ll get $30 + $30 = $60 added to your 401k every paycheck. 
- Generous compensation plans may offer 6% or higher matches, and your paycheck may be significantly higher than $1000. It is surprising how much the balance in a 401k can increase after just one or two years of steady employement.
- The primary differences between a Roth IRA and a 401k are as follows:
  - You can contribute to a Roth IRA even if you are not currently employed, and/or if your employer does not offer a 401k plan.
  - Contribution to a 401k requires current employment. The contributions are deducted from your paycheck prior to taxes.
  - The money that you put into a Roth IRA has already been taxed; you can think of it as cash you have on hand before you put it into the Roth IRA. Because of this, you do not need to ay taxes when you withdraw your money from your Roth IRA (assuming you are above the minimum age for withdrawl, typically 60 years old).
  - The money that you put into a 401k has not yet been taxed; because of this, you must pay taxes when you withdraw.

## Tracking Cash Flow

A little more than a year ago, I started to track every single transaction I made in real time using a simple spreadsheet. I found it extremely helpful in organizing and optimizing how I spent my money. One surprising benefit that I wasn't expecting but ended up enjoying was that it meant that there was suddenly more friction when I made a purchase. This doesn't necessarily sound like a good thing, but I found that using contactless Apple Pay to buy something and not even looking at the receipt made it a little too easy to spend money. By tracking transactions in real time, whenever I bought something it meant I then had to open the Google Sheets app on my phone and painstakingly enter the details of the transaction (date, amount, name, category, payment method), which takes at least 30 seconds. After doing this a few dozen times, I started to think twice before buying a juice or T shirt or whatever in a random store: "Do I really want to deal with the Google Sheets app right now?" 

The other, much more significant benefit, is that I was able to obtain crystal-clear and up-to-date insight as to where my money was coming from and where it was going. By assigning categories myself, and not relying on different credit card companies and peer-to-peer payment platforms(e.g., Venmo) to be able to come up with sane categorizations for my purchases, I had complete control over which transactions I thought of as belonging to which categories. I found it useful to think in terms of the following cash-flow categories: Rent, Groceries, Restaurants, Medicine/Medical, Transportation, Travel, Conference, Paycheck, Interest, Investment, and Retirement Savings, Subscription, Gift, as well as a handful of others (Books, Dance Classes, Clothes, and other smaller but still sufficiently frequent sorts of purchases).

I ended up making a dashboard using Python to visualize my transactions. It reads directly from the Google Sheet and displays a pie chart with a breakdown of my spending my category, as well as other sorts of visualizations for more insight. One tangible improvement that this kind of tracking made on my spending was helping me realize that I was spending too much on restaurants and not enough on groceries. By bringing lunch to work and reducing the number of times I went to restaurants, I was able to cut my restaurant spending by more than 50% and increase grocery spending by about 60%, saving a few hundred dollars each month. (Food is expensive in Hawaii!)

I'll probably write a separate post on the cash-flow tracking itself, because it would be fun to talk more about the spreadsheet and dashboard design.
